## Overview

The **Dashboard** project is designed for optimal data visualization and user engagement. This interactive platform presents dynamic data updates, intuitive navigation, and a streamlined user interface for maximum usability. We use the `database.json` content in the `data.ts` file, which holds all the content from the `database.json` file, and then began working on the project's core functionalities to ensure everything is seamlessly integrated.

This project leverages modern web technologies and frameworks to ensure a responsive and high-performance application:
- **React**: Frontend framework for building interactive user interfaces.
- **Next.js**: Framework for server-side rendering and enhancing React applications.
